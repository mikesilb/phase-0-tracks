ELEVATOR ALGORITHM
------------------

- Ask user, "What floor do you want to be at now?  Must input a positive integer" (This user input will be called 'source')
- Push button to wait to call elevator to your floor
- elevator = random positive integer
- Until source==elevator, stay outside elevator
    - if floor < elevator (elevator needs to go down to my floor)
        - elevator -= 1
    - else (elevator needs to go up to my floor)
        - elevator += 1
- Enter elevator
    - Determine (from user input or a random positive integer what floor you want to go to (I'll call this variable, 'destination').
    - Close elevator door
    - until destination != floor (At the determined floor without even going up or down) 
        - Print "You are already there!  Try again with a different, positive floor number"
    - if destination < floor (Need to go down)
        - while destination != floor
            - floor -= 1
    - elsif destination > floor (Need to go up)
        - while destination != floor 
            - floor += 1
- Open elevator door
- Depart elevator
