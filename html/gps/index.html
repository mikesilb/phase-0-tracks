<!-- Reflection:
The purpose of HTML5 semantic tags is to generate a sensible/meaningful way of categorizing tags based on their semantic meaning, rather than to have an overly generalized characterization for any one tag.  By adding semantic meaning, the tags can be classified/ordered in semantically useful and logical ways.  To name a few, I found the nav, article, and section tags to be very useful towards specifying the type of data that would be expected to be in these tags as well as towards subdividing coherent/logical blocks of information (involving many sub-elements in 'sections').

The browser will display elements on a page in semantic order that it shows up on the page.  It will roughly be from top to bottom but if it is also organized into semantic elements, the browser will group/block together the various sub-elements into larger units.

I learned how to make 'snippets' on Sublime, which are essentially useful shortcuts (that often are user-generated).  Basically, after defining the 'snippets', they can be used by typing the 'keyword' that the user specifies followed by the tab key.  Prior to doing this exercise, a Sublime snippet already existed for 'html' (which would generate the foundational backbone of any html file).  However, it was missing a few items.  Thus, by reformulating a new snippet (that I called 'my_html'), the missing items can be included.  Snippets will be very important in generating useful templates for items that are not yet formatted into Sublime.  I can easily see myself making new snippets, as they will make my coding that much more straightforward to accomplish.

I actually think that going through the instructions on how to make Sublime snippets might have been the hardest part, because I had to separate the relevant material from the less relevant (when I wasn't fully sure what was and wasn't reelvant).  It involved considerable on-the-fly exploration, which I will have to do all-the-time as a coder.  I'm hoping that increased exposure to a wide range of scenarios will greatly get me used to doing it almost automatically.  To me, this was the area of greatest difficulty as it involves maintaining a mindset of wading through a large amount of uncertainty to eventually reach greater clarity.-->
