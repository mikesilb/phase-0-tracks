Learning jQuery (Release 0 of 9.3)

1. Look at multiple sources (not sure which ones just yet)
2. Obtain cheat sheet
3. Every 15 min recap what learned and test myself 
4. Maybe take break every 45-50 min
5. Determine what appears interesting as well as what appears to be pretty fundamental
6. Contemplate how similar/different jQuery is from Javascript itself
7. If possible, try to find ways to integrate with other languages, etc., that have learned previous in Phase0.
8. Treat this as a fun/novel way to find out new ways to sharpen web-dev tools.
9. Find documentation and bookmark it.
