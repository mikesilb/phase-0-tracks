      <p>RUSH is a three-membered progressive rock band from Toronto, ON, Canada.  They consist of singer and bassist, Geddy Lee, guitarist, Alex Lifeson, and drummer Neil Peart.  The band has been in existence for over 40 years.  Their music is technically as sharp as it comes and their sound takes you to a different galaxy altogether.</p>
      <p id="site_commentary">Another site completely devoted to RUSH is <a href=http://www.rush.com/>here</a>. I find this to be a well designed and dynamic website.  Many aspects of the HTML source that I am reading, I can understand, like some of the unordered lists, the headers, the various headline tags, the image insertions, etc.  However, there are also many aspects of this code that I do not understand, especially the script directly underneath the body tag.  It appears to have something to do with Google Analytics, but I don't have such a great sense about what it is meant to do.  There is another section of code near the bottom that has some interfacing with Facebook, but I do not know precisely what it is meant to do.  There are also many HTML tag types that I do not yet have familiarity for, such as the article, span, and noscript tags. So, on the whole, for this really nice looking and dynamic website, there are certain parts that I am beginning to understand, while there are other locations that I still have considerable confusions about.

      <p>I have been a Laker fan since 1981 as I was raised in Los Angeles.  I have witnessed three different championship dynasties in my lifetime:</p>

      <p>I am very interested in understanding what makes people tick.  Likewise, I am fascinated when certain personality type models can predict and somewhat approximate how I perceive the world, and how respond to all sorts of stimuli.  Below are two such typological models that I enjoy learning and applying...</p>

      <h2>Map Reading</h2>
      <p>Ever since I was a young child, I was fascinated by the interwoven complexity of maps.  I literally could spend hours in front of one and feel mesmerized by all its inherent possibilities (as to various trips someone can take).  The specific maps where my intrigue in this area began are:</p>
